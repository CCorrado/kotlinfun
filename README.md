# Kotlin Fun

This is a short Android app written in Kotlin that is totally meaningless but allows you to post data about Meal Prepping to a Firebase backend (sometimes, when it feels like letting you)
Sometimes it'll let you get data back too. Good luck!

## Why Kotlin?

Because it's `fun`. Wait, get it?

## Prerequisites

This example is written in Kotlin and built using Android Studio 3.0 (Beta 5). You will need these to build this project.

## Running the tests

The unit tests (when there are unit tests) are written using JUnit. They can be found in `/app/src/test/java/com/ccorrads/kotlinfun` and run directly in the IDE or by running `./gradlew clean assembleDebug testDebug`

## Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/) - Beta 5 at the time of this writing
* [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/get-started.html) - The `fun` language this is in
